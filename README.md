#School District Analysis
##Module 4: PyCitySchools 
## Objective: Use Python and the Pandas Library to analyze school district data and showcase trends in school performance.
## Resources: 
Data Source:  PyCitySchools.ipynb; PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb; schools_complete.csv; students_complete.csv
Software: Anaconda 3.8.8, Python, Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook
## Background: The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.
## Overview of the project:
### Deliverable 1: Replace Ninth-Grade Reading and Math Scores
Using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators, select the ninth grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School. Then, use the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN.
 
### Deliverable 2** - Repeat the school district analysis
Reformating the following after the 9th grade students from Thomas High School are removed or replaced by NaN.

How is the district summary affected?

How is the school summary affected?


How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
